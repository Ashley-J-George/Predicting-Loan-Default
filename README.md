# Predicting-Credit-Score
In this data science project, we will predict borrowers chance of defaulting on credit loans by building a credit score prediction model.

## **Techniques Used**
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Logistic Regression
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Artifical Neural Networks

> **Out of the five techniques used in this project, it is found that Artifical Neural Networks gives the highest precision of 82%.**

**Dataset:** Credit_Scoring.csv

**All in One Notebook:** Credit_Scoring.ipynb
